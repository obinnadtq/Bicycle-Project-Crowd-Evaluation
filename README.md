# Bicycle Project Crowd Evaluation

## Aim
This is a project that analyzes and visualizes the performance of annotators that were presented with several images and asked if there was a bicycle in the image or not.

The detailed analysis can be found in this [**notebook**](https://github.com/obinnadtq/Bicycle-Project-Crowd-Evaluation/edit/main/codes/Bicycle-Project-Crowd-Evaluation.ipynb)

## Datasets
The two datasets used are named annonymized_project.json and references.json. They have to be downloaded and used in the pandas read_json method.
